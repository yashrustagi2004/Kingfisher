Introduction

Phishing emails are cybersecurity threats that can trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, financial details, or personal data. Traditional rule-based detection methods struggle with evolving phishing tactics. This project aims to develop an NLP-based phishing email detection system that can analyze email content, identify suspicious patterns, and classify emails as phishing or legitimate. By leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques, the system will improve detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and enhance email security.

# Proposed Methodology

1. Checking Email Headers: SPF, DKIM, DMARC
2. Cross-checking the urls in the body in our exhaustive database to detect phishing links.
3. Understanding the sentiment of the email body using NLP and alerting the user for any suspicious email.

# Product Functionality
